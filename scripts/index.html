            <img src="/images/hobby.jpg" alt="Your favorite hobby" width="300" height="200">
            <p> I love making games. I have written books to be used with tabletop RPGs, directed video games, and
                designed card games. I do this, because games are fun, I enjoy making people smile. This falls in line,
                I feel, with all my career goals, and I would aim to turn in into a career, as has been my dream since I
                was a lot younger</p>
