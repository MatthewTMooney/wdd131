            <h2>About Ireland</h2>
            <p>
                Ireland is a small island is western europe, that is well known for it's lush grasslands and rolling
                hills, and plenty of Craic (The Irish Gaelic word for fun, often used by locals)
                During most of it's modern history, Ireland was apart of the United Kingdom, but after a Rising in 1916
                that lasted a week, full blown civil war lead to independent in 1923, and despite a Rocky history, it
                now has a good reletionship with the UK, being each others largest trading partners.
                Ireland is known for being very friendly, though some of this can be put down to the countries pension
                for Alchol, it is still an amazing place to visit for anyone looking to explore a deep history,
                plenitful vegetation, or make plenty of Friends
